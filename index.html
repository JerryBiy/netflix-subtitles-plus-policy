    <h1>Privacy Policy for Netflix Subtitles+</h1>

    <p>
      Netflix Subtitles+ does not collect, transmit, or sell any personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      The extension does not collect personally identifiable information,
      browsing history, or analytics data. It does not track users, display ads,
      or communicate with external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Website Content</h2>
    <p>
      Netflix Subtitles+ interacts with website content on netflix.com only to
      display a subtitle overlay synchronized with video playback. All
      processing occurs locally in the user’s browser.
    </p>

    <h2>User-Provided Data</h2>
    <p>
      Any subtitle files (.srt or .vtt) loaded by the user are processed locally
      and are never uploaded, stored remotely, or shared with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>
      The extension uses Chrome’s local storage to save user preferences such as
      subtitle timing offset, font size, position, and appearance settings.
      These settings remain on the user’s device and are not transmitted.
    </p>

    <h2>Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
      Netflix Subtitles+ does not share data with third parties and does not
      include third-party analytics or tracking libraries.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      This privacy policy may be updated if the extension’s functionality
      changes. Any updates will be reflected at this URL.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact the
      developer via email jerry_chern@outlook.com
